//*In the login Form Component , We can also include the sign up feature so we don't need to build another component for the sign of feature we can use the same signin component both for sign in  & sign up and to do it We have created a state variable named is sign up and we set its initial value to true and no wat the bottom portion of the for mwe have given a clickable paragraph so if we click on that then it will trigger the onclick event of that element and then when that onClick event triggers, Then we set the value to the opposite of the previous value using the (!)not operator. like this -  onClick={() => setIsSignIn(!isSignIn)}.
//* So when the user clicks it and the state variables value become true then depending on that condition we change the form and we also display other input elements(full name input elm) as needed which will be dependent on this state variable we created for sign in  & up.
